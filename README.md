# Multi-Agent-Debate

## üìå Project Overview 
Constructing a debate simulation system using LangGraph where two AI agents engage in a
structured argument over a fixed topic. The system should use memory, control over turns,
and a judging node that evaluates the debate logically and declares a winner.

## üéØ Objectives
Design and implement a LangGraph-based workflow with two alternating agents debating a
fixed topic. The system should preserve and summarize the dialogue history, validate logical
progression, and end with an automated judgment using a dedicated node.

# üß™ Sample Interaction
Enter topic for debate: Should AI be regulated like medicine?     
Starting debate between Scientist and Philosopher...     
[Round 1] Scientist: AI must be regulated due to high-risk applications.    
[Round 2] Philosopher: Regulation could stifle philosophical progress and autonomy.    
...    
[Round 8] Philosopher: History shows overregulation often delays societal evolution.    
[Judge] Summary of debate:
